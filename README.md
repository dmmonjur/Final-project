# Relocation Insights Application

## Project Overview
This project integrates multiple data sources to provide relocation insights, including weather patterns, GDP data, and AI-generated recommendations. The app employs modern tools like LangChain, Streamlit, and advanced API chaining for dynamic data analysis and visualization.

## Installation Instructions
To run this application locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file and providing your API keys.

## Usage
1. Launch the app by running:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
2. Interact with the application through the user interface to explore insights based on various factors.

## Features
- Integrates weather, GDP, and AI-generated insights.
- Real-time data processing through LangChain and API chaining.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## Future Work
- Incorporate additional data sources for a more holistic view.
- Optimize data processing for faster performance.
- Add more AI-driven insights for personalization.
